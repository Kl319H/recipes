Ingredients:

-1 cup (1/2 lb.) butter, at room temperature
-1 1/2 cups firmly packed brown sugar
-2 large eggs
-1 teaspoon vanilla
-2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
-1 teaspoon baking soda
-1/2 teaspoon salt
-2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
-1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:

1.  In a bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter and brown
    sugar until well blended. Beat in eggs and vanilla until smooth, scraping down
    sides of bowl as needed.

2.  In another bowl, mix flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir or beat into butter
    mixture until well incorporated. Stir in chocolate chips and pecans, if using.

3.  Drop dough in 2-tablespoon (1/8-cup) portions, 2 inches apart, onto buttered
    12- by 15-inch baking sheets.

4.  Bake in a 400Â° oven until cookies are lightly browned and no longer wet in
    the center (break one open to check), 6 to 8 minutes; if baking more than one
    pan at a time, switch pan positions halfway through baking.

5.  With a wide spatula, transfer cookies to racks to cool. If hot cookies start
    to break, slide a thin spatula under them to release; let stand on pan to firm
    up, 2 to 5 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely.
